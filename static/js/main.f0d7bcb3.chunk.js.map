This building was designed from the ground up to suit the needs of Nike, incorporating cutting-edge retail experiences designed for customers to test products in real sports environments. The store includes a 400 SF synthetic turf field, a 23’ tall basketball retail space with a hardwood basketball trial zone, as well as NikeiD area for custom printing and laser engraving. My role on this project included envisioning design concepts, producing details and technical drawings, creating renderings, and collaborating with our team of in house designers as well as external consultants and contractors to see our designs all the way through the construction process.<br/><br/>\n\nWhile working on Nike’s NYC Soho store, I was able to focus on the design of the building’s main entrance, which included the custom seating, cash wrap, back wrap, and digital service area. These complex seating elements needed to draw customers in, provide a space to sit, an “Instagram moment”, and serve as a permanent platform for seasonal window displays. <br/><br/>\n\nOur team found inspiration in the nearby High Line park, and chose to incorporate similar elongated stepped seating into the space. These steps were then rotated at an angle to face into the space, towards the Women’s category. The wood grain is also on a bias leading your eye up into the atrium. To bring cohesion to the space, a lit reveal was added to the underside of each stair to match the lighting on the side of the escalators. This study of the stadium seating and one-on-one service kiosk study is a glimpse at the many process iterations which helped identify the specifics and characteristics of the final design.\n<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Renders by Nike Visual Team) </p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t    {SohoImages}\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"l-w0 m-mobileProjLink\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"t-center-all\">Next Up</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Link className=\"m-projLink\" to=\"/athletic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBRS Studio\n\t\t\t\t\t</Link>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</Aux>\n\t\t);\n\t};\n\nexport default Soho;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Aux from '../../../hoc/_Aux/_Aux';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\nimport { Images } from '../Images/Images';\nimport { ChicagoData } from '../../../data/app_data';\nimport chicagoHero from '../../../assets/images/architecture/chicago/chicago___4.jpg';\n\nconst Studio = props => {\n\tlet ChicagoImages = ChicagoData.map((item, index) => {\n\t\treturn <Images item={item} key={index} />;\n\t});\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<Aux>\n\t\t\t\t<Helmet>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title>LIC - Chicago</title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Chicago\" />\n\t\t\t\t</Helmet>\n\t\t\t\t  <div className=\"intro w1\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 className=\"title \">NIKE CHICAGO - HOUSE OF SPORT</h4>\n\t\t\t    <h1 className=\"brandDescription \">669 N Michigan Avenue\nChicago, IL 60611\n</h1>\n\t\t\t    <div className=\"categories\">\n\t\t\t<h5>STORE DESIGN</h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>3D MODELING </h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>TECHNICAL DRAWINGS</h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>RENDER</h5>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t  </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src={chicagoHero} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Athletic Studio\" />\n\t\t\t\t  <div className=\"boundingColor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"categoryTitle blackText w2\">The Project</h2>\n\t\t\t\t  <p className=\"projectCopy blackText w2 m-b-60\">\nNike Chicago store needed a refresh after being remodeled 8 years ago.

As the customers enter the space, the cheese sampling area includes floating tables, designed to loosely resemble cheese curds, the beginning of the cheese-making process. Next, customers encounter the formal cheese tasting and education area, imagined as a space pressed into a form, like a cheese form, and lastly encounter a wall display of the cheeses for sale, resembling the cheese aging process. This retrofit included creating a demolition plan and using the existing roof structure and brick walls to rethink the space.

These typically have a smaller footprint and a more residential feel. The store environment is laid out like a home, with a Welcome area followed by the living room, closet, and kitchen. <br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLocated in the upper Eastside neighborhood, this existing Nike store is on the first floor of a condo building. Reinventing the space to match the new Nike Live rollout concept was a challenge, as the space was quite unique. Its unique characteristics included two entries, low ceilings, and 40+ structural columns (on an irregular column grid) in the sales floor alone. With a relatively tight budget, we needed to leverage the existing store condition to keep construction to a minimum.<br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\t\t\tI was the lead designer for this project, from insight to concept to execution. The beginning phases included collaborating with space planning and visual merchandising to lay out the space. Beyond my typical design responsibilities, I also collaborated with environmental graphic design on the rugs and curtains, designed by a local artist to feel of the place.<br/><br/>\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis project was in partnership with Nike’s internal Store Design, Visual Merchandising, Brand Marketing (NSO and Live), Space Planning, Environmental Graphic Design teams as well as external teams including Superette (Architect of Record) and RTC (fixture vendor).
