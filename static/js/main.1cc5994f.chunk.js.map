occupying an entire 5-storey, 55,000 SF building, was designed to seamlessly bridge Nike’s digital and physical platforms. This building was designed from the ground up to suit the needs of Nike, incorporating cutting-edge retail experiences designed for customers to test products in real sports environments. The store includes a 400 SF synthetic turf field, a 23’ tall basketball retail space with a hardwood basketball trial zone, as well as NikeiD area for custom printing and laser engraving. My role on this project included envisioning design concepts, producing details and technical drawings, creating renderings, and collaborating with our team of in house designers as well as external consultants and contractors to see our designs all the way through the construction process <br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhile working on Nike’s NYC Soho store, I lead the design of the building’s main entrance, which included the custom seating, cash wrap, back wrap, and digital service area. These complex seating elements needed to draw customers in, provide a space to sit, an “Instagram moment”, and serve as a permanent platform for seasonal window displays. Our team found inspiration in the nearby High Line park, and chose to incorporate similar elongated stepped seating into the space. These steps were then rotated at an angle to face into the space, towards the Women’s category. The wood grain is also on a bias leading your eye up into the atrium. To bring cohesion to the space, a lit reveal was added to the underside of each stair to match the lighting on the side of the escalators. This study of the stadium seating and one-on-one service kiosk study is a glimpse at the many process iterations which helped identify the specifics and characteristics of the final design.<br/><br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Renders by Nike Visual Team) </p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t    {SohoImages}\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"l-w0 m-mobileProjLink\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"t-center-all\">Next Up</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Link className=\"m-projLink\" to=\"/athletic\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBRS Studio\n\t\t\t\t\t</Link>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</Aux>\n\t\t);\n\t};\n\nexport default Soho;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Aux from '../../../hoc/_Aux/_Aux';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\nimport { Images } from '../Images/Images';\nimport { ChicagoData } from '../../../data/app_data';\nimport chicagoHero from '../../../assets/images/architecture/chicago/chicago___1.jpg';\n\nconst Studio = props => {\n\tlet ChicagoImages = ChicagoData.map((item, index) => {\n\t\treturn <Images item={item} key={index} />;\n\t});\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<Aux>\n\t\t\t\t<Helmet>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title>LIC - Chicago</title>\n\t\t\t\t\t<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Chicago\" />\n\t\t\t\t</Helmet>\n\t\t\t\t  <div className=\"intro w1\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 className=\"title \">Chicago</h4>\n\t\t\t    <h1 className=\"brandDescription \">Nike Flagship Store</h1>\n\t\t\t    <div className=\"categories\">\n\t\t\t<h5>STORE DESIGN</h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>3D MODELING </h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>TECHNICAL DRAWINGS</h5>\n\t\t\t      <h5>RENDER</h5>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t  </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src={chicagoHero} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Athletic Studio\" />\n\t\t\t\t  <div className=\"boundingColor\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"categoryTitle blackText w2\">The Project</h2>\n\t\t\t\t  <p className=\"projectCopy blackText w2\">\n\t\t\t\t    Nike’s flagship Chicago store needed a refresh after being remodeled 4 years ago. The design goal was to bringing digital service interactions to the first floor. Originally, the Jordan brand was on the first floor but over time the Women’s category took over so the space needed to reflect the lighter palette. We removed the dropped grid ceiling, revealing existing linear lights, and integrated the modern sport look into the Women’s fitting rooms. We also changed the front entry vestibule to have a local, “Instagram moment”, upgraded the initiative window display system, improved the wayfinding to the back of house and added more footwear storage.

This required creating a demolition plan and using the remaining roof structure and brick walls to rethink the space, concurrently inspired by the process of making cheese. The customers essentially move through the shop, experiencing the process of making cheese as a curd. This process begins with the cheese curds (sampling area), then the curds being pressed into a form (formal cheese tasting and education area), and lastly the aging process (display of the cheeses for sale).

I am proposing KID-DOM, an afterschool program which gives children unique mediums through which they can learn, express themselves, and release physical energy. KID-DOM will cater to around 200 children ages 5-14. KID-DOM explores how spaces can encourage creativity, learning, and activity, and foster comfortable and natural interactions. The center will also provide a supplement to school through individualized tutoring, hands-on learning, and incorporating technology to encourage active engagement in topics. Through exercise, artful expression, and heightened learning experiences, I hope that the children will discover self-worth.</p>\n\t\t\t\t  </div>\n{KiddomImages}\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"l-w0 m-mobileProjLink\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 className=\"t-center-all\">Next Up</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Link className=\"m-projLink\" to=\"/crypto\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarriage\n\t\t\t\t\t</Link>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</Aux>\n\t\t);\n\t};\n\nexport default Kiddom;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Aux from '../../../hoc/_Aux/_Aux';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Helmet } from 'react-helmet';\nimport { Images } from '../Images/Images';\nimport { SushiBentoData } from '../../../data/app_data';\nimport SushiBentoHero from '../../../assets/images/architecture/sushibento/sushibento-1.jpg';\n\nconst SushiBento = props => {\n\tlet SushiBentoImages = SushiBentoData.map((item, index) => {\n\t\treturn <Images item={item} key={index} />;\n\t});\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<Aux>\n\t\t\t\t<Helmet>\n\t\t\t\t\t<title>LIC -
